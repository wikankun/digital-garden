# Ubuntu apps recommendation to increase productivity

After we discussed about [[2024-10-27-after-install-ubuntu]], what comes next is what apps to install on our new Ubuntu machine. Here's the list of my personal recommendation of Ubuntu apps:

1. Google Chrome

    Ubuntu comes with Firefox browser installed, but if you prefer Chrome browser then it's wise to install Google Chrome.

2. Notion

    Notion is my favorite app to taking notes.

3. VSCode

    Who else install Ubuntu to code? Then VSCode is our friend.

4. Pyenv

    It might be bothersome to have several versions of python installed on our Ubuntu, but Pyenv has the solution. This app helps us manage python version we want to install and use on specific folder or repository.

5. Postman

    If you're an API developer, you should install this curl's wrapper app. I found Postman is the most interactive between other curl's wrapper.

6. Docker Engine

    Docker Engine is always-on, CLI-based counterpart of Docker Desktop. I prefer this version as I don't want to be bothered to open the App each time I need to run docker.

7. Discord

    As my current company main messaging platform is Discord, I put it here.

8. Dbeaver

    This is my favorite database client app, I've tried other app but neither of them has features in my everyday SQL needs.
