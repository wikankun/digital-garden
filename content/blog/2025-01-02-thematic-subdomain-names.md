## Background

I often find myself intrigued by the subdomain names used at the company where I work. Some subdomains are named after food (kerupuk, ketoprak, etc.), planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars), and even wayang characters (Yudhistira, Bima, Arjuna). It made me wonder: why do companies choose thematic names for their subdomains instead of simply naming them after the services they represent?

## Observations

From my observation, the use of thematic subdomain names serves several purposes:
   
1. Security Through Obscurity
   
   By using unconventional subdomain names, companies can prevent external parties from easily guessing the function of the subdomain. For example, a subdomain named "ketoprak" provides no direct clue about the service it hosts, making it harder for outsiders to identify important endpoints.

2. Memorability
   
   Thematic names are often easier for employees to remember. For example, "bima" and "venus" stand out more compared to generic service names like "api-gateway-123" or "auth-service-456" with the same level of obscurity. This can reduce cognitive load and make internal communication smoother.

3. Culture and Identity
   
   Thematic names often reflect a company's cultures and values. Using local foods or object names that represents the company can create a sense of identity and proce among employees. It can also make the workplace more fun and relatable.
   
4. Aesthetic and Branding Appeal
   
   Having subdomain named after planets or galaxies sounds cooler than sticking to generic, function-based names. It adds a layer of creativity and uniqueness to the company's infrastructure.
   
5. Categorization and Organization
   
   Thematic names can also helps with categorization. For instance, all frontend-related services might use names of planets, while backend services use name of galaxies. This informal system can help employees quickly identify the general area a service belongs to.

## Drawbacks

While thematic names offer many benefits, it also have several potential drawbacks:

1. Scalability

   As the services grow and more subdomain names are needed, you might run out of subdomain names in that specific group. For example, you might run out of planet names, as in our solar system there's only 9 of them.

2. Onboarding Difficulty

   Onboarding new employees might be difficult because they need to learn and memorize subdomain names and the services they represent. This could end up on additional documents for onboarding process.

3. Lack of Clarity

   For external stakeholders, thematic subdomain names might not provide clear indication of what each service does. This might lead to a miscommunication.


## Conclusion

Thematic subdomain naming is a fascinating aspect if tech culture that blends with creativity with functionality. While not without its challenges, it adds a unique layer to how companies organize their digital infrastructure. Whether for memorability, security, or simply to reflect company culture, these subdomain names tell a small but significant story about the company behind them.
