# Why company use thematic subdomain name

I often find myself intrigued by the subdomain names sed at the company where I work. Some subdomains are named after food (kerupuk, ketoprak, etc.), planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars), and even wayang characters (Yudhistira, Bima, Arjuna). It made me wonder: why do companies choose thematic names for their subdomains instead of symply naming them after the services they represent?
## Observations

From my observation, the use of thematic subdomain names serves several purposes:
1. Memorability
   
   Thematic names are often easier for employees to remember. For example, "Bima" and "Venus" stand out more compared to generic service names like "api-gateway" or "auth-service". This can reduce cognitive load and make internal communication smoother.
   
2. Security Through Obscurity
   
   By using unconventional subdomain names, companies can prevent external parties from easily guessing the function of the subdomain. For example, a subdomain named "ketoprak" provides no direct clue about the service it hosts, making it harder for outsiders to identify important endpoints.

3. Culture and Identity
   
   Thematic names often reflect a company's cultures and values. Using local foods or object names that represents the company can create a sense of identity and proce among employees. It can also make the workplace more fun and relatable.
   
4. Aesthetic and Branding Appeal
   
   Having subdomain named after planets or galaxies sounds cooler than sticking to generic, function-based names. It adds a layer of creativity and uniqueness to the company's infrastructure.
   
5. Categorization and Organization
   
   Thematic names can also helps with categorization. For instance, all frontend-related services might use names of planets, while backend services use name of galaxies. This informal system can help employees quickly identify the general area a service belongs to.

## Conclusion

Thematic subdomain naming is a fascinating aspect if tech culture that blends with creativity with functionality. While not without its challenges, it adds a unique layer to how companies organize their digital infrastructure. Whether for memorability, security, or simply to reflect company culture, these subdomain names tell a small but significant story about the company behind them.
